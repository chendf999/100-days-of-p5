# 100-days-of-p5

100 days of p5 is a creative coding challenge. The goal is to test and learn basic generative art and visualization with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Due to the experimental nature of this project, many code sketches created are variants of tutorial exercises, recreations of existing visual effects, or translation of a similar WebGL project. All the code sketches are available on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/Djdgpp) and Github.

To learn more about the process and takeaways, please go to [Daphneâ€™s 100 days of p5](https://chendf.com/100-days-of-p5).
